# Data Types
# String
# Integer - whole numbers numerical
# Float - decimals numerical

# print(type(weather))
# print(type(height))
# print(type(weight))

run1_dist = 1400

# Addition

totaldist = run1_dist + run2_dist
# print(totaldist)

# Floats
run3_dist = 1.7
run4_dist = 1.35

# Addition2

totaldist = run3_dist + run4_dist
# print(totaldist)

#Division and Multi

# print(run1_dist / 1000)
# print(run3_dist * 1000)

# Division always produces floats
# Other calculations depends on data types

# Other Examples
# print(weather + run3_dist) cant add string and number
# print(weather * 5)

# The below is called typecasting, changing a data type
# print(weather + str(run3_dist))
