# Exercise : 1 Ask the user for a number. Use a for loop to print the times tables for that number.

# num = int(input("Enter a number"))
# for i in range(num+1):
#     print(f"{num} * {i} = {num*i}")


# my attempt
# num = int(input("Enter a number"))

# else:
#     for i in range(num+1):
#         result = int(num) * i
#         print(f"{num} * {i} = {result}")


# Exercise: 2 Ask the user for a number. Use a for loop to sum from 0 to that numbe
# total = 0
# num = int(input("Enter a number "))
# for i in range(num+1):
#     total += i

# print(total)


# need to rejig to only print the remaining output, not all the middle digits too

# for loop each number counting up to that number
# and add easch one to the previous
# print the result

# Exercise: 3 Given a list, use a for loop to sum all the numbers in the list.


# here
# total = 0
# random_numbers = [3, 5, 9, 1]

# for num in random_numbers:
#     total += num
#     print(total)
# need to rejig to only print the remaining output, not all the middle digits too

# Exercise : 4  Use a for loop to format and print the following list:

# mailing_list = [
#     ["Chilli", "chilli@thechihuahua.com"],
#     ["Roary", "roary@moth.catchers"],
#     ["Remus", "remus@kapers.dog"],

#     ["Ivy", "noreply@goldendreamers.xyz"],
# ]

# for item in mailing_list:
#     print(f"{item[0]} : {item[1]}")

# success!
